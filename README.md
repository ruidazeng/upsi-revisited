# UPSI Project

## Building the Project

The project build is managed by `bazel` and is set up to run on `v6.4`. To build the project, simply run the following
from the `upsi-new` directory:
```bash
bazel build //upsi:all
```

## Running the Protocol

Before running the protocol, use the `setup` binary to generate encryption keys and mock input sets. By default, the keys
will be put in `out/` and the input sets will be put in `data/`. For example, to generate input datasets with 256
elements for eight days, you would run
```bash
./bazel-bin/upsi/setup --days=8 --daily_size=256
```
If you don't want to start the protocol from the beginning, but want the parties to already have built up their
datasets, you can add `--start_size=` to specify how many elements should be in their trees (e.g., to simulate running
the protocol after 100 days where each day the parties input 64 elements, you would have `--start_size=64000`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to run the protocol to output a secret sharing of the intersection, you will need to add `--func=SS` to
> the `setup` command. Setting up the initial trees requires encrypting elements, which for secret sharing must be
> Paillier encryption whereas all other functionalities use El Gamal (and so El Gamal is the default). If you are
> starting from day 1 (i.e., `--start_size=0`), then technically this can be ignored.

Additional options can be found by running
```bash
./bazel-bin/upsi/setup --help
```

Once you've generated the keys and data sets, you can run the protocol like so
```bash
./bazel-bin/upsi/run --party=1 --days=8 --func=CA
```
and
```bash
./bazel-bin/upsi/run --party=0 --days=8 --func=CA
```
where `--func` specifies which output functionality you want to run. The functionality options are `CA` for cardinality,
`PSI` for regular PSI, `SUM` for the cardinality and sum of associated values, and `SS` is for intersection secret share.
Again, you can use `--help` to see all options for `run`.

> [!NOTE]
> You must run `run --party=1` before `run --party=0` as it acts as the server and listens for connections on the
> specified port.

## Setting Up on Google Cloud

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are setting up a new VM, it needs to be set to have Debian 10 (buster) as its boot disk. Otherwise the
> build will not work.

These instructions are for setting up the project on a completely new machine on Google Cloud.

First, you will need to setup an `ssh` key. You can use an existing key or generate a new one using:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your@email>"
```
To add the key, go to the VM instance on the Google Cloud console, click "EDIT" in the top bar, scroll down to the **SSH
Keys** section, and add the contents of the `.pub` file to a new key.

You should then be able to ssh into the machine however you'd like with the username `upsi` (assuming you've used the
`id_upsi` key â€” other keys may have another username). The IP address can be found on the VM page under **Network
interfaces** as _External IP address_.

To clone the repository the machine will need `git` installed and an authorized key to access GitHub. To install `git`,
you should be able to run
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```
To setup a new key, you can create one by running the following:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your@email>"
```
and adding the contents of the `.pub` file to your GitHub account (under *Settings > SSH and GPG keys*). `upsi-2` has
`id_github` as its key for connecting to GitHub using Max's account.

Before you clone or pull the repository, you may need to add the ssh key to the ssh agent. This can be done by running
the following command:
```bash
eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_github
```

To install Bazel, you can run the commands in [Using Bazel's apt repository](https://bazel.build/install/ubuntu).:
```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl gnupg -y
curl -fsSL https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg | gpg --dearmor >bazel-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo mv bazel-archive-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/bazel-archive-keyring.gpg] https://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt stable jdk1.8" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list

sudo apt update && sudo apt install bazel-6.4.0
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/bazel bazel /usr/bin/bazel-6.4.0 10
```
Note that since our project is pinned to Bazel 6.4.0 you need to install that version specifically.

You will also need to install `python` and `pip` for the build system to work.
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-distutils
```

To use `network_setup.sh`, you will also need to ensure the VM has `tc` setup:
```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/tc tc /usr/sbin/tc 10
```
